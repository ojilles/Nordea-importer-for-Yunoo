# Nordea to Yunoo.nl converter tool


## How to export from Nordeo Netbank

- Login 
- On the next page, select the "Konti" (Account)
- Optionally change the dates near "Periode", click "Hent"
  (This works for me for more than 200+ transactions in one go)
- Scroll down, press "Gem kontobevaegelser", and safe the resulting file


## How to convert it

   php n2y.php < poster.csv > rek1.csv

 
Import this into Yunoo, as if it were an ING account (other banks might work too, but that doens't matter)

NOTE: It uses a fixed exchange rate as defined by EXCHANGE_RATE!
